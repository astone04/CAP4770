Welcome to our CAP4770 Final Project Repository.

We intend to make an app that recommends which type of movie a movie studio should pursue to produce during each time of the year. We will ask questions like time of the year, budget, etc. and provide the user with the genre that will provide them the best profits and ratings.

This project uses Pandas and Python 3.11, so to reproduce our results you must:
    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Make sure you have Python downloaded and correctly installed.
    3. Make sure you have Pandas correctly installed by using 'pip install pandas'.

To start with the data preprocessing you must:
    1. Run removeColumns.py
    2. Run emptyRowChecker.py
